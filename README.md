## Introduction
Zoho Hover Rotation is a frontend mini project developed using pure HTML and CSS.  
This project demonstrates how smooth and interactive UI animations can be created using CSS hover effects and transforms

The design is inspired by Zoho-style branding, focusing on clean visuals, smooth motion, and responsive layout.

---

## Overview
This project is implemented as a single HTML file (`index.html`) with internal CSS styling.

---

### Key Features
- No JavaScript used
- Responsive design using `vw` and `vh`
- Hover-based rotation and 3D tilt effects
- Smooth animation using CSS transitions
- Simple and clean UI design

This project highlights the power of CSS-only animations in modern web development.

---

## CSS Position Explanation
The layout is designed using CSS Flexbox to ensure proper alignment and responsiveness.

### Positioning Details
- `display: flex` is used to arrange elements horizontally
- `justify-content: center` centers the elements horizontally
- `align-items: center` centers the elements vertically
- `gap` is used to maintain equal spacing between elements
- `vw` and `vh` units are used to make the design responsive across screen sizes

Flexbox helps in maintaining a clean and scalable layout without complex positioning.

---

## Hover Effect Details
The interactive behavior is achieved using the CSS `:hover` pseudo-class.

### On Hover
- The element rotates from a diamond shape to a straight position
- A slight 3D tilt effect is applied
- The element scales slightly to create depth
- Brightness increases to highlight the active element

Smooth animation is handled using:
`css
transition: all 1s ease-in-out`;

---

## Transform Details

- CSS `transfor` is the core concept used in this project.


## Default State:

- Elements are rotated by 45deg to form a diamond shape

- Inner text is counter-rotated to remain readable

## Hover State:

- `rotate aligns` the element normally
